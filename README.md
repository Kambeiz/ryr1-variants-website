This repository is dedicated of illustrate some of my work as a PhD student in Bioinformatics.
Its goal is to display in a didactic way RyR1 variants, RyR1 variants, and provide the result of my Machine Learning Model in a simple interface.
To understand these results, will be also explained up-to-date knowledge of the protein, along with basic explaination of score and features used in the variants missense prediction.
