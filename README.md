This repository is dedicated of illustrate some of my work as a PhD student in Bioinformatics.
Its goal is to display in a didactic way RyR1 variants, RyR1 variants, and provide the result of my Machine Learning Model in a simple interface.
To understand these results, will be also explained up-to-date knowledge of the protein, along with basic explaination of score and features used in the variants missense prediction.
This is a work in progress: the style of the website is not yet finalized, and the related data for variants, features and prediction is simply presented here as an example of what will show the final website.
Roadmap:

1. Fix bugs
2. Adding details on the Random Forest used to predict the variants missense
3. Give a good look and structure of the website in a flexbox way
4. Add a page dedicated to Benchmark between the Random Forest and state-of-art methods to predict missense variants
